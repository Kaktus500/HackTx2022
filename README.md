Gesture control for laptops

## GUI Module
Upon running the GUI module, the program will open a GUI. In the GUI you can specify a nickname to a process, 
and give a path to the process. Currently only the OPEN radial button will work as intended.

After starting the training you can check the id of the task by pressing the update models button.
Once that is pressed you can see the id's of everything registered to the system

Then from the command line you can just press that number to open that process
